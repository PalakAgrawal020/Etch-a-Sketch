# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch is the browser version of the toy sketchpad.

First we will create a grid of 16x16 of square divs using JavaScript.
For making the grid, we have used the logic of nested loops. We select the div whose id was container and then added rows to the div and for each row, certain defined number of columns were added.
